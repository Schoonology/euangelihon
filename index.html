    <h2>Genesis 11:1-9 Reading in Spanish [Justin Kuk :: City Harbor Church]</h2>

    <passage>
      <ol class="chapter" value="11">
        <p>
          <li class="first verse">Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.</li>
          <li class="verse">As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li class="verse">They said to each other, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s make bricks and bake them
            thoroughly.&rdquo; They
            used brick instead of
            stone, and tar for mortar.</li>
          <li class="verse">Then they said, &ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the
            heavens,
            so that
            we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.&rdquo;
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li class="verse">But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.</li>
          <li class="verse">The Lord said, &ldquo;If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do
            this, then
            nothing
            they plan to do
            will be impossible for them.</li>
          <li class="verse">Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each
            other.&rdquo;</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li class="verse">So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the
            city.</li>
          <li class="verse">That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole
            world. From
            there the Lord
            scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</li>

    <h2>Acts 2:1-13 Reading in Mandarin [Catherine Yang :: Gallery Church]</h2>

    <passage>
      <ol class="chapter" value="2">
        <p>
          <li class="first verse">When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.</li>
          <li class="verse">Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole
            house where
            they were sitting.</li>
          <li class="verse">They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
          </li>
          <li class="verse">All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the
            Spirit enabled
            them.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li class="verse">Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.</li>
          <li class="verse">When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard
            their own
            language being
            spoken.</li>
          <li class="verse">Utterly amazed, they asked: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t all these who are speaking Galileans?</li>
          <li class="verse">Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?</li>
          <li class="verse">Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and
            Asia,</li>
          <li class="verse">Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome</li>
          <li class="verse">(both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of
            God in our
            own tongues!&rdquo;</li>
          <li class="verse">Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li class="verse">Some, however, made fun of them and said, &ldquo;They have had too much wine.&rdquo;</li>

    <p>
      Holy Father, there is nothing I have that You have not given me. All I have and am belong to You, bought with the
      blood
      of Jesus. To spend everything on myself, and to give without sacrifice, is the way of the world that You cannot
      abide.
      But generosity is the way of those who call Christ their Lord; who love Him with free hearts and serve Him with
      renewed
      minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who withstand the delusion of riches that chokes the word; Whose hearts are in your kingdom and not in the systems
      of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am determined to increase in generosity until it can be said that there is no needy person among us. I am
      determined
      to be trustworthy with such a little thing as money that You may trust me with true riches.
      Above all, I am determined to be generous because You, Father, are generous. It is the delight of Your daughters
      and
      sons to share Your traits, and to show what You are like to all the world.

    <h2>Revelation 7:9-12 Reading in English [ Marika Pinkett :: New Harvest Ministries]</h2>
    <passage>
      <ol class="chapter" value="7">
        <p>
          <li class="verse" value="9">After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could
            count, from every
            nation, tribe, people and language,standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white
            robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.</li>
          <li class="verse">And they cried out in a loud voice:
            <blockquote>
              &ldquo;Salvation belongs to our God,<br>
              who sits on the throne,<br>
              and to the Lamb.&rdquo;
            </blockquote>
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li class="verse">All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living
            creatures.
            They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,</li>
          <li class="verse">saying:
            <blockquote>
              &ldquo;Amen!<br>
              Praise and glory<br>
              and wisdom and thanks and honor<br>
              and power and strength<br>
              be to our God for ever and ever.<br>
              Amen!&rdquo;
            </blockquote>
